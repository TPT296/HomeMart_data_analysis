## Key Insights
- Highest Revenue: Occurs on weekends (Saturday and Sunday), with weekdays seeing significantly lower sales.
- The Dairy Section (Section 3) sees high movement but low interaction, suggesting it is not a key focus area for customers.
- Frozen, Candy, and Dairy sections show the highest interaction from customers, while Food, Books & Toys, and Household sections have lower customer interest.
## Recommendations
- Store Layout Optimization: Focus on serving older customers (60+) in Frozen, Candy, and Dairy sections, and consider upselling opportunities.

- Product Portfolio: Increase visibility and stock for top-selling products, and consider bundling them to increase sales.

- Customer Experience: Improve product displays in the Dairy section and consider promotions to attract more customers on slower days like Tuesday.

- Marketing & Promotions: Test in-store promotions, social media, and email marketing to engage customers. Focus on the more effective discount ranges to boost sales.
